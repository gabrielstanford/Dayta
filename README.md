## About

Dayta performs three key functions: 

1. Journal, the bedrock of the app, gives you an easy interface for tracking your days in full. Using advanced logic to make it quick to add activities, journal emphasizes awareness of your day. Becoming conscious of your activities and your time is a key step to improvement, and gives us the dayta we need to create useful, actionable insights
2. Recommendations uses science-backed principles, in combination with your dayta, to give you actionable recommendations that will make a significant impact on your focus levels, energy levels, quality of focus, and general quality of life.
3. Stats creates visualizations of your dayta to put your time and days in perspective and develop a more profound sense of awareness.
